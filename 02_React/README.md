# React

## Required

* **Node.js**

* **npm**

## How to use

You will need to **replace** a ip address in /src/components/Sensors.js , line 43. Enter your node server's ip address.

Then in the root of the folder, do **```npm install```**, then **```npm start```**. That should start the dev build on port 3000.

If you get **```react-scripts: Permission denied```**, first try **```chmod +x node_modules/.bin/react-scripts```**, if that doesn't help, i've noted that react-scripts version 2.1.8 works. That's why by default in package.json I use that version.

If any other errors arise, again use **Google**.
