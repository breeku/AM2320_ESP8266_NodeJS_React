# NodeJS

## Required

* **Node.js**

* **npm**

## How to use

Refer to **Google** how to install node on your specific Raspberry PI

Inside the folder, do **```npm install```**, then **```node index.js```** and you should get a message that the server is running on port 3001.

After confirming that the ESP8266 is sending data (that is after the second part) and is working fine, you can do **```node index.js &```** so that the server runs even if you close out your SSH session.

If you want to test it without ESP8266, **[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)** is great.
